    "In this notebook, I'll consider the problem of predicting survival on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset. It is based on a Kaggle competition called \"Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster\". We are tackling with Classification problem, we will clean and analyze dataset, and then create machine learning model using scikit-learn library. This solution is created solely for educational purposes."
